RNFLD annotation for the publicly available REFUGE dataset

The dataset, named RNFLD_{refuge}, contains all of the fundus images in the REFUGE dataset. Ophthalmologists annotated these fundus images by bounding RNFLD areas without referring to any auxilary information of the REFUGE dataset. RNFLD_{refuge} uses the same partition setting with the REFUGE dataset. RNFLDrefuge Totally has 1,200 Fundus images, which are separated to three subsets averagely according to their using purpose. The ratios of positive and negative instances in the three subsets are different.

REFUGE was organized as a half day Challenge in conjunction with the 5th MICCAI Workshop on Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis (OMIA), a Satellite Event of the MICCAI 2018 conference in Granada, Spain. The goal of the challenge is to evaluate and compare automated algorithms for glaucoma detection and optic disc/cup segmentation on a common dataset of retinal fundus images. With this challenge, we made available a large dataset of 1200 annotated retinal fundus images. In addition, an evaluation framework has been designed to allow all the submitted results to be evaluated and compared with one another in a uniform manner.
